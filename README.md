# PostSystem
This is a post system simulator.

Three files will be loaded to the system, wanted.txt, postoffice.txt and commands.txt

wanted.txt will contain names that should be forbidden from entering the system.
Postoffice.txt contain post offices that can do mail/parcel delivery related affairs.

The simulator will execute the commands and gives the result, and also provides a GUI for the user to simulate more post system related actions
